# Database Monitoring

A monitoring package for MS SQL Server, useful for weekly measurements and baselines. Nothing overly in-depth, just the basics to get one started and provide some clues for investigations if needed.

The monitoring queries are not mine, they are borrowed and/or modified from [Glenn Berry's Diagnostic Information Queries](https://glennsqlperformance.com/resources/) - pretty much the Gold Standard of diagnostic queries anyone could ask for MS SQL Server.
